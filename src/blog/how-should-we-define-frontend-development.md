Frontend development is a term widely used today with different intentions behind it. Some people refer to it while meaning UX and UI design. Others think that it is nothing but a bit of HTML, CSS and a sparkle of jQuery.
Even though those are aspects of frontend development and parts of it that shouldn't be underestimated or looked down upon in any sense, a frontend developer is expected to know a lot more than the basics.

JavaScript is the core frontend language on the Web, and since it is the primary language that runs in the browser, it is what a frontend developer works with daily. More and more logic is being executed in the browser. Operations that were previously done on the server side are now moving to the client. User-friendly, highly interactive and reactive applications are becoming a standard on the Web. Therefore, it is safe to say that frontend development is programming at its core, and software engineering at a pretty high level.

This is also why all the new JavaScript frameworks are evolving quickly, with big companies backing them up, since there was a huge need for ways to develop big web applications in a sound fashion.

A frontend developer is a software engineer who does serious programming, not a web designer. A frontend developer is expected to know a large set of technologies, starting with the mother language JavaScript and the frameworks that are based on it, to building and bundling tools, task runners, unit testing and a lot more.
