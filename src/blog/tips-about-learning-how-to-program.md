It can be quite confusing as a beginner wanting to learn programming. The Web is packed with information, but knowing where to start and how to progress when learning programming can be a challenge.
The two big questions that arose in my head were:

1. What should I learn?
2. Where should I learn it?

In this article, I will try to discuss these two questions.

## What Should You Learn?

This one is hard especially as a beginner most likely won’t even know the different niches in software development and the various paths that one can take.

Like most questions, the answer would probably be: “it depends” on what your goal is. If your goal is to get a job as a programmer, then you would have to look at the job posts in your area to find out which area of software development has the greatest job demand. A personal recommendation would be to look into web development (frontend, backend or both) considering the great amount of jobs that are available in that area.

If your goal is to build your own app or do some programming tasks on your own instead of hiring someone to do them for you, then it would depend on what kind of tasks you need to get done.

## Where Should You Study?

This is a question where lots of people will give you different answers. In general, there are usually three routes, but I want to focus on the third one:

1. College.
2. Coding boot camps.
3. Self-teaching.

I want to focus on the third route because it’s the one that many people would probably start off with. And to be honest, most developers will probably combine college with self-teaching, or a coding boot camp with self-teaching. You will have to study on your own if you want to sharpen your skills and keep them up-to-date.

### Different Ways of Self-Teaching

Let’s start off by defining what self-teaching is. I would define it as using resources online to teach yourself programming. The big downside to this approach is that you have to build your own curriculum, which is quite hard when you don’t have any clue about what to start with. Here is where pursuing a college degree or attending a boot camp can be helpful because the curriculum is already prepared for you.

I remember myself scrolling through online forums and watching a bunch of YouTube videos by different people talking about which programming languages to begin with and why one language is more preferable than other languages. My first lines of code were actually in Python — mainly because of the online hype around that particular language — even though I don’t do any work in Python today.

As I mentioned before, the most important thing is to know your goal, and then explore which technologies you will need to learn in order to achieve that goal.

### Free Content vs Paid Content

There is an enormous amount of free content available on the Web today. Free learning resources which give you a great introduction to programming and can even teach you a lot about more advanced concepts too. I have consumed free content heavily — mostly on YouTube — and they help out a lot. On the other hand, I have also bought courses on Udemy for example and followed through the content there too. And in my opinion, I find that paid content tends to be more structured and in-depth than free content. So, free content is good for getting acquainted with the basics of a particular technology, but learning about the more advanced topics is probably hard through pure free content. A $10 course on Udemy can help you tremendously in your career, so it might be worth to look into paid content.

To give you a hint about some of the great YouTube channels for learning how to program, I would recommend the following three: TraversyMedia, WebDevSimplified and Academind.

## Interactive Coding Platforms vs Video Tutorials

With interactive coding platforms I mean platforms like FreeCodeCamp.org, Codecademy and so on. These are good because they explain the different concepts in a clear way and you also get to solve problems as you go, which forces you to apply the knowledge that you have just gained. I used to learn from both FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy in the beginning, and I think they are really suitable for some people, but I personally shifted to video tutorials for several reasons:

1. I felt that those platforms weren’t simulating a real development environment. Coding in a small editor inside of the browser is rarely how you would do regular programming tasks at work. I got many tips and tricks from instructors through their screen recordings of their environments and it gave me a better perspective of how real environments would look like.
2. I understood the concepts and managed to solve the exercises, but I didn’t grasp the whole picture and see how things were related. It was first when I followed YouTube and Udemy instructors who went through projects from scratch that I understood how different parts were connected.

In short, I would say that a combination of both is ideal. But if you only have time to focus on one platform, I would suggest sticking with video tutorials — just to get your feet wet with programming, and then building your own projects along with a lot of research and reading technical documentations about the technology stack in question.
