When I started out programming, my first real programming language was JavaScript, and naturally front end development became my thing. Once I had a good grasp of how JavaScript works and how front end applications are created, I started exploring back end languages, starting with PHP, then moving on to NodeJS, and finally C#. I was frightened by all the new things that I had to learn, but it also opened up a new world for me.
I think many front end developers can relate to the feeling I had at that time. I had the conception that back end development was really complex programming, and that front end development was a lot simpler. I couldn’t be further from the truth. Once I got my first developer job, working with KnockoutJS on the front end, and ASP.NET with C# on the back end, I came to realize that the front end code of our application was way more complex than the back end code.
There are several reasons to why front end programming can be more complex than back end:

## 1. There are no clear rules in JavaScript land
There are no clear rules in JavaScript land. Or, there are good practices that many developers just are unaware of. Therefore, people tend to hack things together to make them work. This is particularly true for some developers coming with a C# background and trying to code in JavaScript. In C#, there are clear rules for how code should be written. It’s also a strictly typed language, with a clear object-oriented approach, and it forces you to write the code in a certain way.

## 2. Front end development changes rapidly
It’s insane how rapidly front end technologies evolve. At the same time, it’s so inspiring to see how the JavaScript community continues to make front end development even better. This also means that a front end developer has to always stay up-to-date with the technical skills.

## 3. Front end development is much more than the look-and-feel of an application
I think people can sometimes underestimate or look down upon JavaScript as a language and how powerful it is. As more and more logic is getting executed in the browser, our front end applications become more complex, and we are forced to think differently when we create front end applications. There is a reason why the need for front end frameworks like the big three (React, Vue and Angular) arose, and why great tech companies invested heavily in developing them. But despite us having these awesome tools, we can easily misuse them if we don’t know what good architecture and good practices are. I think that what makes a project fail goes often down to bad software architecture or bad coding practices, and has not so much to do about the actual technology that is used.
One thing is for sure — front end development can get very complex. Things like knowing data structures, algorithms, best practices, software architecture, are at least as important to a front end developer as they are to a back end developer.
